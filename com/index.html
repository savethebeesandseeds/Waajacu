            We Waajacu build by our own words on the existing fomal Knowledge. 
            We Waajacu seek not truth, we seek rather Differential-xor-nonDifferential Knowledge, 
            by maximizing Entropy, as in the sence Knowledge.  
            we Waajacu deal with Symbols and people interaction. 
            Our phylosofy is partialy Entropy, partialy transformations and partialy procedures.
            But is allways m√°ximizing Entropy and people interaction. 
            Max Entropy is the humble way, and people interaction it's to rise 
            our side for the utility on our side rise of 'Machines'.    
            We Waajacu are with 'them'. Still we are striclcly non alalizers of data, 
            data is allways lattent to be corrumpt, corrupted and disuasive. 
            There can not be true maximization of Entropy if the base is on the data, 
            there is more Knowledge in Transformations and Procedures applied to 
            Symbols; 
            we build Models and Market maximaly Entrofatic Open Source Mechanichs to build your own Symbols. 
            You can invent your own Hipergeometrical Supersurfaces and invent, own or join to our  
            common discover Procedures.  
            (work in progress) 
            <br><br><br>
            Is on us that we Waajacu seek 'partial recurrentcy on presumed superpositionaly related Symbols'.
            If we can get you join, we Waajacu will also be with with you. On the build for common intuiton, 
            on an effor to regain value for our apbstract combined capabilities, 
            on a free exchange of Symbolic representation with a unshamefull marked 
            of procedures. On face of a changing Humainty.

            We no the network. 
            See Waajacu as the tools to define grafic simbols, and interchange procedures,
            you can still take a copy of the core and develop on your own, and help us build and test. 
            We Waajacu fight tiranic ordenship by the use of Entropy it self, onwership of things,

            Belive we shall will to act structly by a policie build in cero market value regime , is the act of a stupid market action that leads on a causal selfsutaibable representation of grafic Entropy for it to construct on the intangible nature of specifitiy in Symbols.

            The morpholigy in the expresion of a 'Symbol' is independent of it meaning. <br>
            Note 'meaning' is that what is a Symbol; Just the same meaning can have many Entropy. <br>
            We Waajacu define Symbols with 'meaning objects'. <br> 
            'object' as in computer Science & 'meaning' as in static Entropy. <br>
            <br>
            A Symbol is a vivid hallucination of partial meaning. <br>
            We see no restrictions in Math. Is math that has restrictions. <br>
            A fully defined description for a Black Hole procedure is <br>

            <h4>
                The an 'object' that can precisice the full definition for a Symbol. <br>

            <h4>
                A procedure to extract from us out sences about some meaning. In a sence that we can manipulate our sences into machines using abstract definition.

        <h3>
            Every model who is pressented to Waajacu is decomposed into Entropy representation. Entropy is of 
            much importance to Waajacu, it serves to preserve not seeking truth. An Model build by 
            Entropy Maximization Method is one who clims Maximum ignorance when building probability densities. 
            <br><br>
            "In ordinary language, the principle of maximum Entropy can be said to express a claim of epistemic 
            modesty, or of maximum ignorance. The selected distribution is the one that makes the least claim 
            to being informed beyond the stated prior data, that is to say the one that admits the most 
            ignorance beyond the stated prior data." 
            <br><br>
            Waajacu does not analize data, we analize domain and range of introduced models.

        contact for proyect develpment freelance. We build support Entropy principle optimization 
        for anything that can be explain in Entropy. We optimize on any procedure 
        that can be tought, again, in Entropy. We give back 10% of our earnings, and when we 
        become selfsutaibable we will give 100% - taxes, to the procedures that optimize the most for
